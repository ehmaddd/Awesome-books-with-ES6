# 📖 <a name="about-project">Awesome Books : ES6</a>

This website is about the book library having the list of all books. This website contains the ADD button to add new books in the collection, REMOVE button to remove any book from the system and also a display of all book names alongwith the names of authors. On the top of everything, it is created using all the brand new modular approach introduced by ES6 in which different parts are created in the form of modules and then exported. The page which requires any module imports it and uses it as it is present on the same page. It saves the effort and time consumed in the repetition and gives code an organized look.
